This an advanced Agriculture Assistance Tool that integrates analytics, crop management, and real-time data to optimize farming productivity. I built this app to combine my passion for helping agriculture and technology, creating a platform where people can connect and share their culinary creations. The project allowed me to work on both front-end and back-end development, enhancing my full-stack development skills.
